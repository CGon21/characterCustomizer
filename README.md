# characterCustomizer

Assignment: Use the HTML forms and P5.js to enable a minimum of five input types
that control the canvas. Consider using text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes,
select lists, and range sliders. For example: a text field might control the number
of objects displayed, a checkbox might be used to pause/unpause or reset the animation,
and a slider could be used to adjust the speed, size, or color of the animated object(s).

I made a character customizer with several inputs.
